# README for BSPy

BSPy is a collection of python code for analyzing simulations of peptides in
lipid bilayers. A few collaborators are using this code, so hopefully it will
be updated regularly.

Minimal documentation can be found [here](http://bspy.perrinresearch.com).
Since this is poorly documented, contact Scott if you'd like to use this code.

Scott's To Do:
 1. Remove obsolete code
 2. Comment and document non-obsolete code
 3. Add in new modules:
    - Water-count.py
    - Resdist work-up
    - getStates
